heat 1

wine 1

my 1
heart 1

mortifying 1
groans 1
why 1
should 1
a 1
man 1

warm 1
within 1
sit 1
like 1

sort 1
of 1
men 1
whose 1

cream 1

like 1
a 1
standing 1

nothing 1
when 1
i 1
am 1
very 1
sure 1
if 1

gratiano 1
speaks 1
an 1
infinite 1
deal 1
of 1
nothing 1
more 1
than 1
any 1
man 1
in 1
all 1
venice 1
his 1
reasons 1
are 1
as 1
two 1
grains 1
of 1
wheat 1
hid 1
in 1
two 1
bushels 1
of 1
chaff 1
you 1
shall 1
seek 1
all 1
day 1
ere 1
you 1
find 1
them 1
and 1
when 1
you 1
have 1
them 1
they 1
are 1
not 1

now 1
what 1
lady 1
is 1

to 1
whom 1
you 1
swore 1
a 1
secret 1
pilgrimage 1
that 1
you 1
to 1
day 1
promised 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
of 1
bassanio 1
tis 1
not 1
unknown 1
to 1
you 1
antonio 1
how 1
much 1
i 1
have 1
disabled 1
mine 1
estate 1
by 1
something 1
showing 1
a 1
more 1
swelling 1
port 1
than 1
my 1
faint 1
means 1
would 1
grant 1
continuance 1
nor 1
do 1
i 1
now 1
make 1
moan 1
to 1
be 1
abridged 1
from 1
such 1
a 1
noble 1
rate 1
but 1
my 1
chief 1
care 1
is 1
to 1
come 1
fairly 1
off 1
from 1
the 1
great 1
debts 1
wherein 1
my 1
time 1
something 1
too 1
prodigal 1
hath 1
left 1

gaged 1
to 1
you 1
antonio 1

owe 1
the 1
most 1
in 1
money 1
and 1
in 1
love 1
and 1
from 1
your 1
love 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
warranty 1
to 1
unburden 1
all 1
my 1
plots 1
and 1
purposes 1
how 1
to 1
get 1
clear 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
debts 1
i 1
owe 1
antonio 1
i 1
pray 1
you 1
good 1
bassanio 1
let 1
me 1
know 1
it 1
and 1
if 1
it 1
stand 1
as 1
you 1
yourself 1
still 1
do 1
within 1
the 1

nothing 2
but 2
talk 2
of 2
his 2
horse 2
and 2
he 2
makes 2
it 2
a 2
great 2
appropriation 2
to 2
his 2
own 2
good 2
parts 2
that 2
he 2
can 2
shoe 2

prove 2
the 2
weeping 2
philosopher 2
when 2
he 2
grows 2
old 2
being 2
so 2
full 2
of 2

pass 2
for 2
a 2
man 2
in 2
truth 2
i 2
know 2
it 2
is 2
a 2
sin 2
to 2

a 2
mocker 2
but 2
he 2
why 2
he 2
hath 2
a 2
horse 2
better 2
than 2
the 2
neapolitan 2
s 2
a 2
better 2
bad 2
habit 2
of 2

with 2
his 2
own 2
shadow 2
if 2
i 2
should 2
marry 2
him 2
i 2
should 2
marry 2
twenty 2
husbands 2
if 2
he 2
would 2
despise 2
me 2
i 2
would 2
forgive 2
him 2
for 2
if 2
he 2
love 2
me 2

him 2
he 2
hath 2
neither 2
latin 2
french 2

italian 2
and 2
you 2
will 2
come 2
into 2
the 2

swear 2
that 2
i 2

a 2

alas 2
who 2
can 2
converse 2
with 2
a 2
dumb 2
show 2
how 2
oddly 2
he 2
is 2
suited 2
i 2
think 2
he 2
bought 2
his 2
doublet 2
in 2
italy 2
his 2
round 2
hose 2
in 2
france 2

you 2
of 2
the 2
scottish 2

that 2
he 2
hath 2
a 2
neighbourly 2
charity 2
in 2
him 2
for 2
he 2
borrowed 2
a 2
box 2
of 2
the 2
ear 2
of 2

swore 2
he 2
would 2
pay 2
him 2
again 2
when 2
he 2
was 2
able 2
i 2
think 2
the 2
frenchman 2
became 2
his 2
surety 2
and 2
sealed 2
under 2
for 2
another 2
nerissa 2
how 2
like 2

very 2
vilely 2
in 2
the 2
morning 2
when 2
he 2
is 2
sober 2
and 2
most 2
vilely 2
in 2
the 2
afternoon 2
when 2
he 2
is 2
drunk 2
when 2
he 2
is 2
best 2
he 2
is 2
a 2
little 2
worse 2
than 2
a 2

and 2
when 2
he 2
is 2
worst 2
he 2
is 2
little 2
better 2
than 2
a 2
beast 2
and 2
the 2
worst 2
fall 2
that 2
ever 2
fell 2
i 2
hope 2
i 2
shall 2
make 2
shift 2
to 2
go 2
without 2
him 2
nerissa 2
if 2
he 2
should 2
offer 2

choose 2
the 2
right 2

when 15
my 15

but 15
let 15

then 15
then 15

lord 15

lose 15
or 15

ruin 15
of 15

my 15
blood 15
speaks 15
to 15
you 15
in 15
my 15
veins 15
and 15
there 15
is 15
such 15
confusion 15
in 15
my 15
powers 15
as 15
after 15
some 15
oration 15
fairly 15
spoke 15
by 15
a 15
beloved 15
prince 15
there 15
doth 15
appear 15
among 15
the 15
buzzing 15
pleased 15
multitude 15
where 15
every 15
something 15
being 15
blent 15
together 15
turns 15
to 15
a 15
wild 15
of 15
nothing 15
save 15
of 15
joy 15
express 15
d 15
and 15
not 15
express 15
d 15
but 15
when 15
this 15
ring 15
parts 15
from 15
this 15
finger 15
then 15
parts 15
life 15
from 15
hence 15
o 15
then 15

in 21

still 21
quiring 21

such 21
harmony 21

whilst 21
this 21
muddy 21
vesture 21

close 21

am 21
never 21
merry 21

the 21
reason 21
is 21
your 21
spirits 21
are 21
attentive 21
for 21
do 21
but 21
note 21
a 21
wild 21
and 21
wanton 21
herd 21
or 21
race 21
of 21
youthful 21
and 21
unhandled 21
colts 21
fetching 21
mad 21
bounds 21
bellowing 21
and 21
neighing 21
loud 21
which 21
is 21
the 21
hot 21
condition 21
of 21
their 21
blood 21
if 21
they 21
but 21
hear 21
perchance 21
a 21
trumpet 21
sound 21
or 21
any 21
air 21
of 21
music 21
touch 21
their 21
ears 21
you 21
shall 21
perceive 21
them 21
make 21
a 21
mutual 21
stand 21
their 21
savage 21
eyes 21
turn 21
d 21
to 21
a 21
modest 21
gaze 21
by 21
the 21
sweet 21
power 21
of 21
music 21
therefore 21
the 21
poet 21
did 21
feign 21
that 21
orpheus 21
drew 21
trees 21
stones 21
and 21
floods 21
since 21
nought 21
so 21
stockish 21
hard 21
and 21
full 21
of 21
rage 21
but 21
music 21
for 21
the 21
time 21
doth 21
change 21
his 21
nature 21
the 21
man 21
that 21
hath 21
no 21
music 21
in 21
himself 21
nor 21
is 21
not 21
moved 21
with 21
concord 21
of 21
sweet 21
sounds 21
is 21
fit 21
for 21
treasons 21
stratagems 21
and 21
spoils 21
the 21
motions 21
of 21
his 21
spirit 21
are 21
dull 21
as 21
night 21
and 21
his 21
affections 21
dark 21
as 21
erebus 21
let 21
no 21
such 21
man 21
be 21
trusted 21
mark 21
the 21
music 21

nerissa 21

that 21
light 21

burning 21
in 21
my 21
hall 21
how 21
far 21

little 21
candle 21
throws 21
his 21
beams 21

so 21
much 21
unreasonable 21
